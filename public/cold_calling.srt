1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,480
well it's wednesday again so time for

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,439
another clip

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,080
today's clip is from a call earlier last

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:06,640
week

5
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,080
with the business owner who's

6
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,679
implementing the strategy of cold

7
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,040
calling in his business

8
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,679
and he was struggling to understand why

9
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:15,360
when he tried to cold sell

10
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,640
that is you know get on the phone with

11
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,400
someone through a cold call and try to

12
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,840
sell to them directly

13
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,560
it wasn't working the way he wanted we

14
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,320
went over the concept of the difference

15
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,920
between cold calling

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,960
and cold selling here's a clip

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,880
i understand what you mean um what i'm

18
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,320
curious to know is i i know you

19
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,280
mentioned you're you're

20
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
struggling with cold calling but are you

21
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,440
cold calling or are you cold selling

22
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,000
okay let me explain so cold calling is

23
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,200
simply the process of calling someone

24
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,719
you don't know it's it's calling someone

25
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,480
who's a cold contact someone you've

26
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,600
you've never had a previous touch point

27
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,680
with cold selling on the other hand is a

28
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,280
subset of cold calling where in addition

29
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,640
to calling someone you don't know

30
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,920
you're actually trying to sell them

31
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,000
something so in in the situation you

32
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,480
describe

33
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,840
what you're struggling with is it

34
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
specifically called calling or is it is

35
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,800
it code selling

36
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
okay yeah that's that that's that's sort

37
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
of what i thought um so what i what i'd

38
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,680
suggest is

39
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,040
leaning more towards cold calling than

40
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
cold selling now cold selling is

41
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,520
is it's a completely different beast and

42
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,119
i'm fairly certain no one likes

43
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,960
getting cold cold calls that are called

44
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,479
sales whereas people

45
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,159
will frequently enjoy cold calls if they

46
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,080
create value for them so what i mean by

47
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,720
that is

48
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
when you're cold calling the fundamental

49
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,320
focus should be to build a relationship

50
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,880
with the person

51
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,640
you're you're you're contacting to

52
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,000
understand them to qualify

53
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,600
them not to sell them you don't want to

54
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,200
sell to them in that first cold call

55
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
now there are some rare circumstances

56
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,479
where what you're selling

57
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,479
you know exactly that that person is is

58
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,240
someone who's interested but most most

59
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,799
cases

60
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,560
those are warm calls those are people

61
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,560
have opted in they're part of some list

62
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,560
they have they have they've taken some

63
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
action to indicate that they want

64
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
to be sold that product which doesn't

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,200
make them cold anymore it makes them

66
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,799
warm or you know lukewarm or

67
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,000
however you want to you you want to

68
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
classify it but when it comes to cold

69
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
calling when you're first reaching out

70
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,399
to a prospect they don't know anything

71
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:54,960
about you

72
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,000
they don't know what your product is

73
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,119
they don't know what your services they

74
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,240
don't know what your offer is

75
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,759
you don't even know if if they're

76
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,360
qualified to purchase your product or

77
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,840
service

78
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,240
you should not be trying to sell to them

79
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
one one fantastic example my

80
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,080
sales coach used to give me was think of

81
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,520
you know when you go out on a date when

82
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,560
you go out for your first date what

83
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
would happen if you asked the person to

84
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
if you propose to the person you know

85
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,200
you had a great hour two three

86
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
hour long date and then all of a sudden

87
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,239
you get down on one knee and propose

88
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,160
right what what would they think yeah

89
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,840
you're right you probably get some

90
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,640
strange looks and

91
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,680
there's a high probability you'll

92
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,360
probably never hear from that person

93
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,840
again

94
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,599
it's a similar experience when you're

95
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,120
trying to cold sell to someone you just

96
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,680
cold called

97
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
right you have just introduced yourself

98
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,720
they just became aware of

99
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,920
of who you are before they had an

100
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,879
opportunity to learn more about your

101
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:35,760
product or your service

102
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,200
you're trying to propose to them you're

103
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,200
trying to get them to give you

104
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,560
their money right which from from a

105
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
business perspective is very similar

106
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,319
to you know when when a life partner

107
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,400
says yes now a lot of people don't cover

108
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,440
this but i mean

109
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,640
i don't want to go into too much depth

110
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
on it but essentially the reality of the

111
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
situation is is it's much harder

112
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
to end a business relationship than it

113
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,959
is to end a marriage it's unfortunate

114
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,599
that's how it is

115
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,959
but that's the reality of it right so

116
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,400
when you when you cold call someone and

117
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,440
you're attempting to

118
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
sell to them instantly on the phone

119
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
you've spoken to them maybe 90 seconds

120
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,879
and you get your pitch in

121
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,920
it's a high chance it's not going to

122
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
work because it's not a good experience

123
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
because for that customer's perspective

124
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,640
they see you as just chasing the money

125
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
they see you as not really focused on on

126
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,599
delivering value and i know there are

127
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,640
some exceptions and there are people out

128
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,280
there that are

129
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,400
exceptionally good at it and there's

130
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,680
specific services and products that

131
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,800
might be a good fit for it

132
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
but fundamentally speaking overall cold

133
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,760
calling is about calling someone you've

134
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,879
never spoken to

135
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,319
and building a relationship with them

136
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,680
doing the foundations of that

137
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,319
relationship

138
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,840
rather than trying to sell to them does

139
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,000
that make sense yeah i i understand what

140
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
you mean it can it can be very time

141
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
consuming but if you focus on shifting

142
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,200
you know cold calls from trying to get a

143
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,799
sale what you'll start to find is people

144
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,920
are going to be more engaged because the

145
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,280
types of conversation you have

146
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,400
you're not going to be rushing to get

147
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,599
them to a point where they say yes or no

148
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,400
to buy your stuff

149
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,519
and then you try and get them on the

150
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,200
phone it's genius people know people can

151
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,640
pick up on it i'm sure you've received

152
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
calls and within the first five or ten

153
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
seconds ago this guy's going to sell me

154
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,760
something

155
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,360
i'm just not interested right whereas if

156
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,480
you get a call about someone trying to

157
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,680
show interest in you trying trying to

158
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,640
understand hey you know what

159
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,879
i i saw on your website you guys do seo

160
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,000
can you tell me a little bit more

161
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,920
about about that if they start to

162
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,760
qualify themselves if they start to

163
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
assess in that cold call is this someone

164
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
i need to sell my product or service to

165
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,040
it creates a fundamentally

166
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,239
better experience and the same will

167
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,920
happen if you focus on creating a

168
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,040
similar experience for you

169
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,120
for your potential clients when you cold

170
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
call them right so

171
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
the objective of a cold call i think the

172
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,918
best objective to have from a cold call

173
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:18,238
is

174
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,798
to set up another call a a longer call

175
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,479
maybe 15 minutes 20 minutes half an hour

176
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,440
or an hour if

177
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,520
if it's the right fit but that first

178
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
call is literally just to validate

179
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,479
qualify is this is this person a

180
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:29,520
potential customer

181
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,000
if they are a potential customer what

182
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
sort of services or products that i have

183
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,720
will they need

184
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,400
and to what extent will the amount of

185
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
value i create to them need to be

186
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
integrated in their business

187
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,880
what i mean by that is a lot of times

188
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,400
the products or services or what you

189
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,040
offer

190
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
need to be customized for that specific

191
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,040
business just a little bit

192
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,320
in that cold call what you want to do is

193
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,160
you want to assess how sophisticated are

194
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
they as a customer where do they fall

195
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,800
within the

196
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,639
the the target customers that you have

197
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,160
do they have money to buy your services

198
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,000
you don't want to spend three weeks

199
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,040
going through a sales process with

200
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
someone who fundamentally

201
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,960
can't buy from you right so that first

202
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,280
call

203
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,680
is really about just assessing is this

204
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,800
someone i want to build a relationship

205
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,199
with

206
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,400
you want to build relationships with

207
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,600
customers that have money that are

208
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,960
eligible to buy your services right you

209
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,080
don't want to build relationships

210
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,759
with people that are fun that you know

211
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,039
that that's a personal thing that has

212
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,080
nothing to do with your business

213
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
right so when you're cold calling what i

214
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,120
would encourage you to do is

215
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
focus on really trying to identify and

216
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,440
understand that that customer learn more

217
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,479
about their business

218
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,000
right learn more about if your product

219
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,680
or service is a good fit and if it's not

220
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,280
no harm no foul just you know you can

221
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
you can end the call right there be like

222
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,160
you know what i really appreciate you

223
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,600
use uh spending some time to explain

224
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,919
your business um this is what i do i

225
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,800
don't think it's a

226
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,240
it's a right fit give them give them an

227
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,000
opportunity to to say yes or no but

228
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,880
fundamentally most people will

229
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,160
appreciate that most people will enjoy

230
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,440
that because it's so different

231
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
from all the other cold selling cold

232
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,800
calls that they get right so

233
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,280
again i suggest focusing on cold calling

234
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
rather than coal selling and i'm sure

235
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,160
what you'll you'll start to see is

236
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,080
is a difference in in your motivation

237
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
and a difference in the way the

238
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,560
conversations go

239
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,560
does that make sense i hope you found

240
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,759
that clip useful

241
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,720

242
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,080
you ever heard of the difference between

243
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,039
cold calling and cold selling before

244
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,880
if you're a freelancer or business owner
